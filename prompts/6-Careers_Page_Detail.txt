Signalton, sıradan bir yazılım evi değil; donanım, gömülü yazılım ve bulut teknolojilerini birleştiren bir R&D (Ar-Ge) merkezi. Bu yüzden kariyer sayfası, "iş ilanı"ndan çok bir "meydan okuma" (challenge) gibi tınlamalıdır.

Yetenekli mühendisleri çekmek için "Sınırları Zorlamak", "Gerçek Dünyaya Dokunmak" ve "Geleceği İnşa Etmek" temalarını işleyen, Sanity CMS yapısına uygun İngilizce içerik planı aşağıdadır.
