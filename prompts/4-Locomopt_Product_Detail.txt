Locomopt, Signalton'un "Akıllı Mobilite" ve "Filo Yönetimi" dikeyindeki çözümüdür. Arama sonuçlarından elde ettiğimiz bilgilere göre; bu ürün sadece basit bir GPS takibi değil, "IoT/Edge GIS Data Platform" olarak tanımlanan, araç sağlığı (lastik aşınması, düşme tespiti) ve sürüş güvenliği (DMS) odaklı gelişmiş bir platformdur.

Aşağıda Locomopt için Sanity CMS yapısına uygun, ürünün hem yazılım (GIS Platformu) hem de donanım (DataMote entegrasyonu) kaslarını gösteren içerik planı ve "Master Prompt" yer almaktadır.

Part 1: Sanity CMS Content Structure (English)

2. Module: Hero Section (The Promise)
Headline: Redefining Urban Mobility

Sub-headline: The complete IoT/Edge GIS Data Platform for micromobility operators and fleet managers. Orchestrate your vehicles with precision, from location tracking to predictive maintenance.

Primary Button: Request Platform Demo

Secondary Button: Explore Hardware

Visual Strategy: A dynamic, high-angle visual of a city street with "digital twins" of scooters and bikes moving, connected by data lines to a floating "Locomopt" dashboard.

3. Module: Key Capabilities (Grid Layout)
Item 1 (GIS & Tracking):

Icon: Map / Pin

Title: Precision GIS Tracking

Body: Monitor your fleet on a live GIS (Geographic Information System) layer. Get sub-meter accuracy on vehicle location, speed, and heading.

Item 2 (Safety & Security):

Icon: Shield / Alert

Title: Fall & Crash Detection

Body: Detect accidents instantly. Locomopt processes accelerometer data at the edge (via DataMote) to identify falls or impacts and alert operation teams immediately.

Item 3 (Control):

Icon: Lock / Unlock

Title: Remote Command

Body: Take full control. Remotely lock/unlock vehicles, immobilize stolen assets, and manage battery power usage—all from the cloud dashboard.

4. Module: The "Edge" Advantage (Spotlight Feature)
Headline: Predictive Maintenance at the Edge

Body: Most platforms only tell you where the vehicle is. Locomopt tells you how it is. Using advanced signal analysis, Locomopt can detect tyre wear and structural anomalies before they cause a breakdown. Reduce operational costs by servicing vehicles only when needed, not on a blind schedule.

Visual Strategy: A close-up schematic of a tire or vehicle wheel with a "Health Bar" overlay, indicating 85% health, demonstrating the predictive analysis capability.

5. Module: Ecosystem Integration (How it works)
Headline: Powered by DataMote

Body: Locomopt is the brain; DataMote is the heart. The platform natively integrates with Signalton's DataMote telemetry unit to extract CAN-bus data, battery levels, and sensor diagnostics without complex configuration.

Visual Strategy: An image showing the DataMote hardware board connecting to a scooter's internal wiring, with an arrow pointing to the Locomopt software screen.

6. Module: Use Cases (Tabs)
Tab 1: Micromobility Sharing

Scooters & E-bikes. Battery swapping management, geofencing enforcement, and user billing integration.

Tab 2: Corporate Fleets

Light commercial vehicles. Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) to detect fatigue or aggressive driving behaviors.

Tab 3: Smart Logistics

Real-time cargo tracking and cold-chain monitoring.

7. Module: Footer CTA
