3. Module: Value Proposition (3-Column Grid)
Why choose DataMote? Focus on "Remote" and "Tracking".

Item 1:

Icon: Signal / Antenna

Title: Always Connected

Body: Built-in 4G/LTE and GSM/GPRS fallback ensure your data reaches the cloud from anywhere. Supports MQTT/S and HTTP/S protocols for seamless integration with AWS, Azure, or custom backends.

Item 2:

Icon: Map Pin / Location

Title: Precision Tracking

Body: Integrated GNSS receiver (GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou) provides location accuracy under 2 meters. Perfect for tracking mobile assets, vehicle fleets, or micromobility solutions.

Item 3:

Icon: Database / Storage

Title: Blackbox Logging

Body: With 1Gb of onboard Flash memory, DataMote acts as a reliable data logger. Even if the network fails, your data is stored locally and synced when connectivity is restored.

4. Module: Technical Deep Dive (Split Layout)
Detailed specs for the engineers.

Section Title: Rugged Telemetry & Control

Rich Text Body: DataMote is the ultimate bridge for "Cloud-Side AI." It collects high-fidelity sensor data and transmits it securely for central processing.

Tasarım ve Görsel İpuçları (DataMote Özelinde)
Renk Ayrımı: SigMote için daha "Cyber/AI" renkleri (Neon maviler, morlar) kullanıyorsanız, DataMote için daha "Endüstriyel/Güvenilir" renkler (Turuncu, Koyu Gri veya Signalton Yeşili) kullanabilirsiniz.

Anten Vurgusu: Görsellerde board'a takılı antenleri (küçük pigtail kablolar veya SMA konnektörler) göstermek, ürünün "Kablosuz" yeteneğini bilinçaltına işler.

Harita Motifi: Arka planlarda silik harita veya topografya çizgileri kullanmak, ürünün GPS/Takip özelliğine gönderme yapar.

Bu içerik planı, DataMote'u SigMote'un bir alternatifi değil, tamamlayıcısı (Cloud AI vs Edge AI) olarak konumlandırır.
