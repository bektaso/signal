Harika. SigCloud, önceki donanım odaklı ürünlerin (SigMote ve DataMote) tamamlayıcısı olarak "Orkestrasyon ve Analiz" katmanıdır.

Arama sonuçlarından edindiğim bilgilere göre SigCloud; AVAS (Akustik/Titreşim), AQNS (Hava Kalitesi/Gürültü) ve Locomopt (Mikromobilite) gibi farklı dikey çözümlerin verilerini toplayan, görselleştiren ve yöneten merkezi platformdur.

Aşağıda SigCloud için Sanity CMS yapısına uygun, kapsamlı İngilizce içerik planı, görsel önerileri ve bunları ürettirecek "Master Prompt" yer almaktadır.
